        <h1>MY PCTO – MATTEO PETRELLINI</h1>
    <main class="content">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I had my experience of PCTO by Oniro Solution Srl – Scorcelletti (AN) and it was a really helpful experience for my personal and professional growth.</p>
        
        <h2>Company Overview</h2>
        <p>Oniro Solution Srl is a company working in the automotive sector. It deals with material handling and automated warehouse, electronic components working and testing lines as well as standardized machines with special applications. They are organized into several departments including software design and development where I worked for all the period of my internship.</p>
        
        <h2>Work Schedule</h2>
        <p>I stayed in this company for five weeks from 8.30 am to 12.30 am and from 1.30 pm to 5.30 pm all weekdays from Monday to Friday. When I arrived there the first day I was welcomed in a very positive way and they soon treated me as if I were part of the staff. They soon asked me my skills, therefore what I was able to do in line with my studies and gave me immediately a project to carry on and develop, named TRIS. This project was about implementing the games TRIS and NAVAL BATTLE and both had to be totally interactive. They asked me to not take any pictures as we were in an industrial context and nothing had to be disclosed for the privacy laws but, except for these basic rules, I started to work right away.</p>
        
        <h2>Performance and Feedback</h2>
        <p>I have been told I was working in a very reliable way, I accomplished all the tasks requested and I tried to be always on time in delivering them. The project they gave me was not too complex to carry out, so I was happy because I was able to do every work assigned. I was almost every time autonomous and when I wanted to know how to do something in particular I asked and they were soon available to help me.</p>
        
        <h2>Skills and Learning</h2>
        <p>I have learnt how to put into practice all the theoretical notions I had learnt at school and the way I could work in a real company, not only in terms of practical activities but also in the job organization. I have learnt to program with C-Sharp, C++ and also how to use the SQL language. I was always working at my computer and never dealt with documentation because this was part of the activity of a person working in the department.</p>
        
        <h2>Resources Used</h2>
        <p>For completing my tasks I used the PC and the material provided by my teachers useful in case I could not remember something in particular.</p>
        
        <h2>Communication with Tutor</h2>
        <p>My tutor never came directly to the company where I worked but we agreed that if there were any issues with the task assigned I should have informed him of everything. I was lucky because nothing bad happened, so I had no need to call him.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I think that this experience has been really formative and interesting because now I know exactly how to stay in a real working context which is very important for my future career.</p>
